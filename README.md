# Morphology_Designer

Morphology_Designer is a research project that demonstrates a data-driven approach to offer valuable insights for architects, urban designers, and planners by emphasizing the significance of morphological analysis, through building footprint data, and in understanding the spatial characteristics and composition of residential buildings within cities. The derived typologies offer a systematic framework for evaluating the diverse building forms, sizes, and distributions. Finally, it proposes a design tool for remote analysts and individuals requiring comprehensive city and building information. 

Thesis project code and data packages.


First, begin with the GH file; you can import your shape files.
Then, take the data and copy/export it to CSV.

From there, work with any pre-processing necessary for your own data. Then, run the Python files on this code. 

The GS results are an example of how, by using the XY coordinates, I was then able to match the buildings within the GIS file to the cluster results.
